# CISC474-Project1

## Notes
This project template contains a simple example of using jquery on a page.  You do not have to use any of it, but it is a good way to get started.

In this example code:
* Jquery is loaded in the head of the html document
* A link to the ```css/styles.css``` file is included in the head of the html document.
* Some simple styles are included in ```css/styles.css```
* The file ```js/main.js``` contains javascript code that makes the site interactive.
* The image folder holds the images used in the example.

There is also a .vscode folder which is set up to enable debugging.

## Getting started
After reviewing the example, you should replace most or all of the example with your code.  I don't want everyone using the same background or buttons style.  Be creative.

I recommend this structure with folders for img, js, and css as it keeps the project nice and organized, but otherwise, you should replace all of the content with your own.
